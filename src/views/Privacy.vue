            <h2>6. Risks</h2>

            <p>6.1. The use of technology related to blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies carries inherent
                risks
                that you assume by engaging in transactions. Olyex.finance does not own or control the underlying software
                on
                which blockchain networks are built. The software for blockchain networks is open-source, allowing anyone to
                use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Interface, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
            </p>

            <p>6.1.1. Olyex.finance is not responsible for the operation of the open-source software and networks underlying
                the
                Interface.</p>

            <p>6.1.2. There is no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of the software and networks.
            </p>

            <p>6.1.3. The underlying networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as forks, which can
                significantly impact the Interface.</p>

            <p>You are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). If you
                lose
                control of your private key(s), you will permanently and irreversibly lose access to any blockchain-based
                network. Neither Olyex.finance nor any other person or entity can retrieve or protect your digital assets.
                Losing your private key(s) will render you unable to transfer your digital assets to any blockchain address
                or
                wallet, resulting in the loss of any value or utility associated with your digital assets.</p>

            <p>6.2. Olyex.finance is not responsible for the content of any third-party websites, including information,
                materials, products, or services that Olyex.finance does not own or control. Third parties may also offer

                for
                such resources or promotions. If you choose to access any third-party resources or participate in
                promotions,
                you do so at your own risk, understanding that these Terms do not apply to your interactions or
                relationships
                with third parties. You expressly release Olyex.finance from any liability arising from the use of such
                resources or participation in such promotions.</p>

            <p>6.3. You understand that the zKsync blockchains are still under development, which poses technological and
                security risks when using the Interface, in addition to uncertainties related to digital assets and
                transactions. You acknowledge that the cost of transactions on the zKsync blockchains is variable and may
                increase at any time, affecting activities conducted on these blockchains and potentially resulting in price
                fluctuations or increased costs when using the Interface.</p>

            <p>6.4. Transactions made through the Interface are irreversible and final, and there are no refunds. You
                acknowledge and accept that you use the Interface at your own risk.</p>

            <p>6.5. Olyex.finance must comply with Applicable Law, which may require us to take certain actions or provide
                information that may not be in your best interests, upon request by government agencies.</p>

                liability
                for the risks outlined in Section 9. You hereby waive, release, and discharge all claims, known or unknown,
                against Olyex.finance, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers,
                employees, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors relating to any risks described in this

                such
                damages. This limitation of liability applies even if the essential purpose of these Terms fails or any
                limited
                remedy provided herein fails to meet its essential purpose. Olyex.finance is not responsible for the
                execution
                or settlement of transactions between users of the Interface.</p>

            <p>In no event shall Olyex.finance&#39;s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Site or
                Interface exceed one thousand Singapore Dollars (1,000.00 SGD).</p>

            <h1>10. Indemnification</h1>

            <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Olyex.finance, its affiliates, members, managers, employees,
                attorneys, representatives, suppliers, and contractors from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding,
                investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost, or expense, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, arising
                out
                of or relating to: (a) your use of or conduct in connection with the Site or the Interface; (b) your
                violation
                of these Terms; (c) your misuse of the Site or the Interface, or any smart contract and/or script related
                thereto; (d) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any
                governmental or quasi-governmental authorities; (e) your violation of the rights of any third party,
                including
                any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property, or privacy right; (f) your use of a
                third-party product, service, and/or website; or (g) any misrepresentation made by you. We reserve the
                right, at
                your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you,
                and
                you agree to cooperate with our defense of any such claim. You shall not, in any event, settle any claim
                without
                our prior written consent.</p>

            <h1>11. Dispute Resolution &amp; Arbitration</h1>

            <p>Olyex.finance will use its best efforts to resolve potential disputes through informal, good faith
                negotiations.
                If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending a written notice of your claim
                (&quot;Notice&quot;) to Olyex.finance on any of our official channels. The notice must (a) describe the
                nature
                and basis of the claim and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in
                form
                to that described above. If you and Olyex.finance cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within
                sixty
                (60) days of your email, then you and Olyex.finance agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the
                process set forth below.</p>

            <p>Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Site, the Interface, or these Terms, or any other
                acts
                or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including (but not limited to) any claim or
                controversy as to arbitrability (&quot;Dispute&quot;), shall be finally and exclusively settled by
                arbitration
                under the Corte Civil y Mercantil de Arbitraje (CIMA). You understand that you are required to resolve all
                Disputes by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be confidential before a single arbitrator, who shall
                be
                selected pursuant to the CIMA rules. The arbitration will be held in Madrid, Spain, unless you and we both
                agree
                to hold it elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those
                of
                any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
                competent
                jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Site or the Interface must be filed within one year
                after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Olyex.finance
                will
                not have the right to assert the claim.</p>

            <h1>12. Governing Law</h1>

                Terms
                will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other
                agreement supersedes these Terms.</p>

            <p>13.8. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party
